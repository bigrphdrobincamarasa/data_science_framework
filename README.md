# Data Science Framework 

[Docs](http://nx-framework.com/docs)

**data\_science\_framework is a modular data science framework - built as Pytorch framework.**
data\_science\_framework is a tiny library, that allows you to develop your own customable datascience project.
The main idea is that data science project are built by blocks. It exists 3 kind of blocks :

- **Data Organizer Block** : Take row data directory as input and organize it in a structured way
- **Data Process Block** : Take a previous experiment(s) block(s) as input and output

As in your mind those blocks have a structure this structure must be seen in the code as shown in the following picture.
In order to create an efficient process it is important that each block do only one task and that each block
is highly customable.
